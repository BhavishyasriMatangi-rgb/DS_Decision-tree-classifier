# PRODIGY_DS_03-Decision-tree-classifier
building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data using the data set such as the bank marketing dataset from the UCI machine learning repository
# Task-03: Decision Tree Classifier

## Objective
Build a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset
Bank Marketing Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
File used: bank-additional-full.csv

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and encoding
3. Train-test split
4. Decision Tree model building
5. Model evaluation
6. Visualization of decision tree

## Model Used
Decision Tree Classifier (Gini Index)

## Result
The model predicts customer purchase behavior with good accuracy and provides interpretable decision rules.

## Conclusion
Decision Trees help understand key factors influencing customer decisions and are effective for classification problems involving customer behavior.
